ScribbleLive All Events Page
===============

**Create your own custom ScribbleLive all events page.**

PHP files that communicate with the ScribbleLive API to get a list of all of the events connected to a white label site and display them on a web page.

This allows you to fully customize your all events page, and have your events still link to your usual white label site.
